# BEST Robotics Gizmo

Welcome, lets drive some robots!  The Gizmo is an open source and open
hardware platform developed in cooperation with the team behind [BEST
Robotics](https://bestrobotics.org) which you can use to build and
control robots.  The system is composed of multiple parts including a
[hardware device](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/gizmo-hw) that
contains the control components, the Gizmo utilities (this repo), the
system software that runs on the hardware
[firmware](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/gizmo-fw), and an [Arduino
library](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/ArduinoGizmo) that lets you
build custom code to control your robot.

## Documentation

You can find our complete documentation online
[here](https://gizmo-platform.github.io) which includes introductory
programming tutorials, instructions for installing firmware, and
guides on how to run practice and competition mode fields.
